# VEEAMTASK
Ammended repository for the veeam QA C# task.
The applicable test task for the VEEAM interview. In regards with the task at hand and my thougths about it, and what can be improved with it.

This is the command line I used to test the app:

dotnet run veeam1.csproj d:\newSource d:\targetFile d:\outputLogger.txt 1000";

It was an excellent test, and really made me scour the microsoft documentation for the information i needed, and some sites i wouldn't have found otherwise like https://www.dotnetperls.com/.

The rest of the classes are located in the SERVICES directory.
